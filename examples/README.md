Examples is a collection of miscellaneous example scripts that can mostly be run using lua_openscript_cl or lua_openscript if you have medialib and required extensions installed.

They might be outdated, in which case you should leave an issue indicating which one of them is not working. Please make sure to check that media links are still valid and you are not forgetting any extensions.
