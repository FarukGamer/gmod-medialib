Extensions are medialib modules that are experimental in nature or not needed by majority of users.

To use an extensions, place it into ```autorun/``` folder in either your ```lua/``` folder or your addon's ```lua/``` folder. As long as the extension is loaded in shared context, it should work.

If correctly installed, the extension will automatically load and add wanted functionality.
