Service extensions are services for more obscure websites. 

To use them, place them in one of the following folders:

Folder | When to use
---|---
```garrysmod/addons/medialib/lua/medialib/services/``` | if you use medialib as an addon
```garrysmod/addons/[youraddon]]/lua/medialib/services/``` | if you use ```dist/medialib.lua``` as part of your addon (```medialib/services/``` folders need to be created)
```garrysmod/lua/medialib/services/``` | if you use ```dist/medialib.lua``` as part of your gamemode (```medialib/services/``` folders need to be created)

If correctly installed, the service will automatically load.
